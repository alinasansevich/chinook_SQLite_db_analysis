# chinook_SQLite_db_analysis

_This is a practice repo, to hone my skills with pandas + SQLite + Jupyter Notebook + seaborn.
I'm just exploring the SQLite sample database "Chinook", that I downloaded from [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

## About the Chinook database

The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

    Media-related data was created using real data from an Apple iTunes library.
  
    Customer and employee information was created using fictitious names and addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.)
  
    Sales information was auto generated using random data for a four year period.

The Chinook sample database includes:

- 11 tables
- A variety of indexes, primary and foreign key constraints
- Over 15,000 rows of data

For details, here's the entity relationship diagram of the Chinook data model:
